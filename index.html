    <i>The Workout Plan</i> has been devised over many years of hard work and experimentation with different exercises tested to find the optimal split for muscle growth. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
    The split that we concluded was the most optimal is known as the Upper/Lower split. This consists of three upper days and two lower days, which equates to a total of five days.
