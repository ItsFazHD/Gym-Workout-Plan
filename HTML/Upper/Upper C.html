        <dd>What Is A Reverse Curl (Pronated Curl) The pronated curl, also known as reverse curl, follows the same movement pattern as the bicep curl to bring the weight to the shoulders, but uses a reversed grip so that the palms are facing downwards. This can be done with dumbbells, barbells, and EZ bars.</dd>

        <br>
        <dd>Pushdowns with the straight bar focus work on the long head of the tricep. The straight bar will place your hands in an overhand grip with your knuckles facing up. With the elbows tight against the body, the long head of the tricep activates as the arms straighten.</dd>

        <dt><u><b>Back: Deadlift</b></u></dt>
        <br>
        <dd>The deadlift is a movement in which your hips hinge backward to lower down and pick up a weighted barbell or kettlebell from the floor. Your back is flat throughout the movement. Some benefits of performing deadlifts include strengthening and gaining more definition in your upper and lower back, glutes, and hamstrings.</dd>
